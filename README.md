# Fake-News-Detection
The challenge to combat the menace of fake news is essential for the maintenance
of authenticity of various media sources. We have used machine learning and
natural language processing to identify the fake news which can be used to combat
the fake news problem. We have used two models, Attention Integrate(AI) model
and 3HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network) [SFR17] in our project. We have
focused on using the attention mechanism to check the relevancy of words and
sentences in the articles. We merged the context info from both headlines and
articles to decide the genuineness of the article.
